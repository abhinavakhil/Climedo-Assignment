# ClimedoAssignment

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.0.

## Few Points i would like to add :
1) metmuseum api was constantly giving cors errors so have added the code but i was not able to fully integrate the metmuseum api to the ui because of cors error.
2) I have implemented the ui and the dialogs with the mock data and added the code for the metmuseum api calls.
3) Used Angular, bootstrap, primeNg and font-awesome.
4) I know its not fully operational but if given the opprtunity i would look forward to give my best, Thanks.
